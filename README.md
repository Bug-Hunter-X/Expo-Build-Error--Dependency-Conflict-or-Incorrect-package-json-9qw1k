# Expo Build Error: Dependency Conflict or Incorrect package.json

This repository demonstrates a common build error in Expo projects stemming from dependency conflicts or issues within the `package.json` file.  The error prevents successful building and deployment of the Expo application.

## Description
The bug showcased involves a situation where a mismatch or incompatibility between libraries leads to a build failure.  The `bug.js` file represents a simplified example demonstrating the issue.  The `bugSolution.js` file then shows how to resolve the problem.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd expo-dependency-conflict`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Attempt to build the app: `expo build:android` or `expo build:ios` (you will encounter the build error)

## Solution
The solution, demonstrated in `bugSolution.js`, typically involves:
- Carefully reviewing the `package.json` file for version mismatches or conflicting dependencies.
- Resolving dependency conflicts using tools like `npm-check-updates` or `npm dedupe`.
- Manually adjusting dependency versions to resolve incompatibilities.  Checking the documentation of each package to ensure compatibility is recommended.
- Updating expo CLI using `expo upgrade` may resolve issues if they're from outdated Expo CLI.

By following the steps in `bugSolution.js`, you can fix the dependency conflict and successfully build your Expo app.
