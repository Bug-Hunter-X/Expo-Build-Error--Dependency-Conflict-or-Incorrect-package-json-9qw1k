While building an Expo app, I encountered an error related to a missing dependency or an incorrect configuration within the `package.json` file. Specifically, the error message pointed towards a conflict or incompatibility between certain libraries or their versions.  The issue manifested during the build process, preventing the app from successfully generating the necessary bundles for deployment.
