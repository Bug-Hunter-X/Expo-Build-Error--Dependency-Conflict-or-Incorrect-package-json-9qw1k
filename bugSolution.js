The solution involves carefully examining the `package.json` file and resolving dependency conflicts.  This often requires:

1. **Identifying conflicting dependencies:** Use tools like `npm ls` to inspect the dependency tree and identify potential clashes.
2. **Resolving version mismatches:**  Check for incompatible versions of packages.  The `npm-check-updates` package can help identify outdated dependencies.
3. **Using npm-dedupe:** Running `npm dedupe` can help flatten the dependency tree and eliminate redundancy, which might resolve certain conflicts.
4. **Manually adjusting versions (if necessary):** In some cases, you'll need to manually specify compatible versions of libraries in your `package.json` file.  Consult documentation for individual libraries.
5. **Cleaning the cache:** Sometimes clearing the Expo cache can help (`expo prebuild --clean`).
6. **Updating Expo:** Run `expo upgrade` to ensure you have the latest version of Expo CLI and its dependencies.
